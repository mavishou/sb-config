# Config of Sublime Text 3

Sublime Text 3 is a wonderful editor. It has numerous plugins. But some of them need to be costomized.

This repositary records my config files. Commments in each file will show you how to use them. The default file is in the first commit. Use  `git diff` to check what I have modified.
